# My DevOps Exam Project

This is my project where I did a bunch of DevOps stuff. Here’s what I worked on in each section.

## Section 2: Setting Up the EC2
I made an EC2 on AWS with Terraform. It’s called "builder" and I got screenshots of it running.

## Section 3: Dockerizing the App
I put my Flask app in a Docker container. It worked on the EC2, but showed an error like it was supposed to. I got a screenshot.

## Section 4: Fixing the Bug
I fixed a bug in the Flask app so it shows AWS stuff like VPCs and Load Balancers. It worked on the EC2, and I got a screenshot.

## Section 5: Jenkins CI/CD
I set up Jenkins on the EC2 and made a pipeline to build and push my Docker image to Docker Hub. It worked, and I got screenshots.

## Section 5.1: Azure DevOps Pipeline
I tried to make a pipeline in Azure DevOps, but the login didn’t work at first. I got new details later, but didn’t finish it yet.

## Section 6: Kubernetes Deployment
I wrote files to run my app on Kubernetes. It worked on a VM they gave us, but I got an error when I tried it. I have a screenshot anyway.

## Section 7: Helm Chart
I made a Helm chart for my app. I didn’t run it because the EC2 ran out of space, but I put it in GitHub.

## What’s Here
All my code and files are in main now. Each branch has its own stuff, and I’ll add READMEs to them later.
